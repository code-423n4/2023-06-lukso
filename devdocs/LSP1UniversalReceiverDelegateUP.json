  "details": "This UniversalReceiverDelegate follows the {LSP1-UniversalReceiver} standards and is designed for LSP0ERC725Account contracts.Handles two cases: - Registers the address of received assets (exclusively LSP7 and LSP8) and vaults (exclusively LSP9) according   to {LSP5-ReceivedAssets} and {LSP10-ReceivedVaults} respectively   https://github.com/lukso-network/LIPs/blob/main/LSPs/LSP-5-ReceivedAssets.md   https://github.com/lukso-network/LIPs/blob/main/LSPs/LSP-10-ReceivedVaults.md - Removes the address of registered assets and vaults when the full balance is sent from the LSP0ERC725Account contract Requirements: - The contract should be able to setData the LSP5 and LSP10 data Keys according to the logic of the owner    of the LSP0ERC725Account. For example, for contracts that are owned by an LSP6KeyManager, this contract should be granted the SUPER/SETDATA and REENTRANCY Permission. Assets and Vaults that are compliant with this version of the UniversalReceiverDelegate are: - LSP7-DigitalAsset: https://github.com/lukso-network/LIPs/blob/main/LSPs/LSP-7-DigitalAsset.md - LSP8-IdentifiableDigitalAsset: https://github.com/lukso-network/LIPs/blob/main/LSPs/LSP-8-IdentifiableDigitalAsset.md - LSP9-Vault: https://github.com/lukso-network/LIPs/blob/main/LSPs/LSP-9-Vault.md",
