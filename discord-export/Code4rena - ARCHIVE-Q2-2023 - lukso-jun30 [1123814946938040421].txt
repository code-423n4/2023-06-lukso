Put together a one-pager that's less dense the C4 page. Also do an analysis on the following contracts:
- ILSP0ERC725Account
- LSP9Vault 
- ILSP14Ownable2Step

I think LSP9Vault is out of scope.

[07/01/2023 20:44] yamenmerhi
True, LSP9Vault is out of scope itself as correctness of code and functionalities but the contracts in scope (LSP0ERC725Account - LSP1UniversalReceiverDelegateUP) expect the use of LSP9Vault.

For example one of the goals of LSP1UniversalReceiverDelegateUP is to detect ownership transfer of LSP9Vaults and register the received vaults in the ERC725Y storage of the LSP0ERC725Account according to LSP10ReceivedVaults standard

This happens when an LSP0 accept ownership of an LSP9Vault, the LSP9Vault automatically will call the universalReceiver function on the new owner (LSP0) to notify about the new acceptance of ownership, and then the universalReceiver function of LSP0 will call the universalReceiver function on the LSP1UniversalReceiverDelegateUP (when this contract is set as UniversalReceiverDelegate of the LSP0)

hello,
What is the main way to contact Accounts? LSP0 or LSP6?

{Reactions}
LUKSOsignetnavy 

[07/02/2023 11:12] yamenmerhi
Not sure i understand what do you mean by 'contact Accounts'

an LSP0ERC725Account is the main account, and LSP6KeyManager can be set as an owner of the LSP0ERC725Account.

When owned by an EOA, the EOA can call directly the functions of the LSP0.

When owned by an LSP6, the controllers (according to LSP6) can either call the LSP0 through the LSP6. (calling execute of the LSP6 --> that calls the functions of the LSP0) **OR** the controllers can call the functions of the LSP0 directly since the LSP0 supports the LSP20CallVerification and LSP6 support LSP20CallVerifier functions


[07/02/2023 11:15] yamenmerhi
---------------------------------------------

The LSP20CallVerification support was added to the LSP0 to have a unified way of interacting with the account regardless of the owner (if the owner support LSP20CallVerifier)


[07/02/2023 11:16] yamenmerhi
But with both ways you can interact with LSP0, either through the LSP6 or directly through the LSP0

@0xYamen Hey, is there any difference in code/scope compared to the last audit? I mean, which part from the scope is uncovered by the previous audits?


[07/02/2023 14:01] yamenmerhi
The last audit was with Trust where the scope of the audit was the same as this one except the Tokens represented by LSP7 and LSP8. From the last audit till now, the changes were very minimal, but for the other audits they were constantly happening while the development whenever we added a feature or changed the architecture. 

The main focus was on LSP1 LSP0 LSP6 and few audits targeted LSP7 and LSP8

Hello wardens! üëã 
I hope you all had a great week-end and are ready and motivated to audit the lsp-smart-contracts! üëä 

For those who are looking at the codebase of the `LSP6KeyManager.sol` contract, here is a Youtube video that I did with the_bytecode that goes over the Solidity source code of the `executeRelayCall(...)` function.

It will help you understand the following:
- how a relay transaction is encoded + signed.
- multi channel nonces.
- how nonces are verified and incremented.
- some basics overview of how a permission is verified with bitwise `AND` / `&`

[07/04/2023 07:55] cj42 (pinned)
Wardens, if you come across functions that look like this and wonder why we made the function `payable` but reverted if some value is sent to it, here are the rationale.

```js
function setData(
    bytes32 dataKey,
    bytes memory dataValue
) public payable virtual override onlyOwner {
    if (msg.value != 0) revert ERC725Y_MsgValueDisallowed();
    _setData(dataKey, dataValue);
}
```

In Solidity, you cannot override a function as follow:
- neither override from `payable` -‚ûù `nonpayable` ‚ùå
- nor from `nonpayable` -‚ûù `payable` ‚ùå

We want to enforce that no value can be sent to this function
But allow anyone to override the behaviour if they want this function to allow accepting value.

Since we cannot override from `nonpayable` ‚Äî> `payable`, we decided to make the function always `payable` (to allow overriding this behaviour) but revert by default if value is sent (to make it feels like if it is `nonpayable`)

Asked by @wangxx2026 but thought sharing it as well for anyone else so that you get the context.

LSP20CallVerification._verifyCall(_owner); Could you explain in more detail how this works? magicValue is confusing@CJ42


[07/04/2023 08:22] cj42
Yes sure. This is the high level idea of LSP20.
To not have to go through the owner of the contract, but just call the contract directly.

The contract will see that the call does not come from the `owner` directly, so it will forward the calldata to the `owner`.
> In this picture, the `owner` is the Key Manager but it can be anything.

The owner then performs the verification logic (or any other logic), and return a result back to the actual contract in the form of a `LSP20 Magic Value`.

Let me draw on top of that to explain

Hi, I wonder why do we need to grant LSP1UniversalReceiverDelegateUP reentrancy permission?


[07/04/2023 08:34] yamenmerhi (pinned)
The Flow of interaction is the following:

- LSP0 call transfer on a LSP7token X 
- Token X will inform the sender and the recipient of the transfer through universalReceiver function
- The universalReceiver function on the sender, will call the `LSP1UniversalReceiverDelegateUP` if set.
- The `LSP1UniversalReceiverDelegateUP` will now need to remove the address of the asset sent and other data keys on the LSP0 since the LSP0 does not own anymore of this asset
- The `LSP1UniversalReceiverDelegateUP` will need to setData to remove these data keys, so needs the SETDATA permission.
- Since the LSP0 initiated a call in the same tx that trigger the transfer function of LSP7token X, it means we are reentering the LSP0 to do setData this time, so it needs the REENTRANCY Permission


[07/04/2023 08:34] yamenmerhi
The Reentrancy permission should be checked against the contract that is reentering not initiating the call that reenters


[07/04/2023 08:35] cj42
The internal function `_verifyCall(...)` will call the public `lsp20VerifyCall(...)` on the owner contract.
And it will return the MAGIC VALUE.

From this you have 3 potential value returned

[07/04/2023 08:35] __melonwater
got it, thanks


[07/04/2023 08:37] yamenmerhi
For instance if i call a protocol X, and the protocol X have a bunch of external calls, and one of these external calls targeted the LSP0 that already initiated a call to the protocol, the contract doing the external call should have reentrancy permission because it's trying to execute an action in the background

{Reactions}
üôè 

[07/04/2023 08:42] cj42
The magic value MUST start with `0x9bf04b` as its first 3 bytes.

_case 1:_ if the magic value starts with these first 3 bytes `0x9bf04b`, that means the verification succeeded, there is nothing else that needs to be done. The function can be executed (e.g: ERC725Y `setData(bytes32,bytes)`).

_case 2: _ if the magic value is `0x9bf04b01` (with these first 3 bytes + the 4th byte is **strictly `01`**), that means the verification succeeded, but the contract has to do a post verification because the function being run is making an external call (e.g: ERC725X `execute(uint256,address,uint256,bytes)`). This is necessary to prevent scenario of reentrancy in particular.

> Note: for case1, we don't care what the 4th byte is, as long as it is not `01`

_case 3:_ if the value being returned does not start with `0x9bf04b`, it is an invalid magic value, so we revert with the custom error `LSP20InvalidMagicValue`

```js
// bytes4(bytes.concat(bytes3(ILSP20.lsp20VerifyCall.selector), hex"01"))
bytes4 constant _LSP20_VERIFY_CALL_MAGIC_VALUE_WITH_POST_VERIFICATION = 0x9bf04b01;

// bytes4(bytes.concat(bytes3(ILSP20.lsp20VerifyCall.selector), hex"00"))
bytes4 constant _LSP20_VERIFY_CALL_MAGIC_VALUE_WITHOUT_POST_VERIFICATION = 0x9bf04b00;
```

[07/04/2023 09:04] yamenmerhi
LSP0 have an owner KeyManager X

Lets say EOA A, called `setData` function, the setData function will identify that the caller is the not the owner.‚Ä®‚Ä®

The setData function will use the internal `_verifyCall` function to call the `lsp20VerifyCall(..)` function on the owner passing the caller (EOA A), value (0 let‚Äôs say), the calldata (setting 2 data keys let‚Äôs say).‚Ä®‚Ä®

The role of the `lsp20VerifyCall(..)` function is to have a logic that verify wether the call is allowed based on the parameter. ‚Ä®‚Ä®

In the case of the KeyManager, we well check the permission of the caller (EOA A), if he has permission to set these data keys (taken from calldata), then the function will return the magic value if the caller is allowed.‚Ä®‚Ä®

The `lsp20VerifyCallResult` in the KeyManager serve to re-set back to the Reentrnacy guard to false.‚Ä®‚Ä®

When a setData is done, we don‚Äôt set the Reentrnacy guard to true because setData cannot reenter, that‚Äôs why we don‚Äôt need to trigger the `lsp20VerifyCallResult` in case of setData. 

So we return the magic value (3 bytes with whatever byte at the end but not `0x01`)

When an execute is done, we set the Reentrnacy guard to true because execute can reenter, that‚Äôs why we need to trigger the `lsp20VerifyCallResult` in case of execute. 

So we return the magic value (3 bytes with`0x01` as the last byte indicating that we need to trigger `lsp20VerifyCallResult` to re-set the reentrancy guard to false)‚Ä®‚Ä®

> in case of execute, only the first execute should trigger the `lsp20VerifyCallResult` function to re-set the reentrancy guard to false, as in case of chaining several execute functions together, you don‚Äôt want the second one to re-set the reentrancy guard to false in the middle and make the subsequent call not require `REENTRACNY` Permission.‚Ä®
> 
> Because `REENTRACNY` permission is only required when the Reentrnacy guard is set to true.


[07/04/2023 09:06] yamenmerhi
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When an LSP0 have an owner such as EOA, or a contract that does not implement the `lsp20VerifyCall` function or a contract that implement the fallback. 

When an EOA X calls a function of the LSP0, this function will see that the caller is not the owner, so it will call the `lsp20VerifyCall` function on the owner. In case of all these owners mentioned above, none of them will return the magic value, so the call verification be unsuccessful and the call will revert

[07/09/2023 07:31] 0xumarkhatab
just reading the docs , thought to ask !

it's stored in `_LSP6KEY_ADDRESSPERMISSIONS_ARRAY`

hi5 

[07/09/2023 08:34] yamenmerhi
Technically you'll check the array Length stored under AddressPermissions[] data key.
If you get for example 2, you know that there is some addresses stored under index 0 and index 1, so you'll write under the index 2
